== M.O.L.D
// What's the MOLD's purpose? To allow for some interaction from the AI on the other side of the wall, giving connection to those eldritch beings. And also to allow peeps to get through walls a la ghost door even in newer places
Every wall has its cracks, and the Blackwall is no different. The AIs on the other side seep through, finding what little purchase they can grasp. In M.O.L.D, they found it.

Some sonuvabitch created barely-secured nanomachines. 1 minute 43 seconds later, MAX-TAC set a new record for response time. They weren't fast enough. Now these little bastards are everywhere. They're so tiny as to be invisible, they can change, evolve and multiply, and they're _receptive_. To AIs. The corps crack down on every colony they find, but all it takes is one. We aren't winning that race.

In short, there are whole growing colonies of microscopic quicksilver bugs out there. We don't know how many: we can't see 'em all, and we can't get 'em all. Useful though, to the right Edgerunner. Those bad boys can do some wicked stuff, if only you're mad enough to wrestle with whatever AI controls 'em.


== Netspace
// In short, YOU get to look like what you want to look like, and everything else lookks like how IT will too
In the net, all your dreams come true! Yes, even if you're not a netrunner; no-one gets left out of the fun here.

See, you can be whatever you wanna be when riding the 'trodes. A team of pilots in screaming jets descending into the airspace of a bristling datafortress? You got it. A dude wielding a chainsaw 5 times your size that wails out power chords when it cuts things in twain? Rock the hell on. You got *style* here, chumba.

Everything else has its rep too. You might have that chainsaw, but you'll need it when you're facing off against the Kraken-class ICE that saw you coming. That datafortress you're flying into? It has some mighty flak cannons ready to chew up any jets that don't dodge, duck, dip, dive or dodge fast enough.

Other than that, the Net is... well, it's a space, it's a place, just a fantastic one. Wanna get somewhere? Gotta find somewhere in the Net with access to it, and travel to it. You have control over *you*. Everything and everyone else is its own thing, and you gotta interact with it to try doin' anything to it.
